# E2E Coverage Inventory

The shared worklist for all seven goals. **Update this in the same PR as the
tests.** Status: `todo` / `done` / `known-bug` (asserted correct, marked
`test.fail()`, issue filed).

The ten G1 rows above are covered by these specs (the two seeding rows
share one file, as do the two principal rows):

- `e2e/tests/pristine/first-run-setup-and-login.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/seeded/authenticated-session.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/seeded/api-fixture.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/seeded/seed-fixture.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/seeded/authorization.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/seeded/async-wait.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/seeded/ws-fixture.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/streaming/stream-client.spec.ts`
- `e2e/tests/streaming/stalled-stream.spec.ts` (regression: read ordering
  across `collectFor` → `readPackets` on a stalled stream)

The four G2 rows above are covered by `e2e-upstream`'s own vitest suite (the
provider and its faults) plus:

- `e2e/tests/seeded/upstream-ingest.spec.ts` (ingest plumbing proof)
- `e2e/tests/streaming/upstream-through-proxy.spec.ts` (stream-through
  plumbing proof)
- `e2e/tests/streaming/upstream-to-control.spec.ts` (`toControl` conversion)
- `e2e/tests/streaming/stream-client.spec.ts` and
  `e2e/tests/streaming/stalled-stream.spec.ts`, both re-pointed at the
  provider (`e2e/support/static-upstream.ts` is deleted)

**G3 and G4 are now unblocked.** Both can seed a scenario, ingest a playlist
or stream through the provider, and drive any of the eight faults, using only
`e2e/fixtures/upstream.ts` and the fault catalogue documented in
`e2e-upstream/README.md` — without reading `e2e-upstream/src/`.

The four G7 rows above are covered by:

- `e2e/tests/lifecycle/upgrade-migrations.spec.ts` (upgrade from previous
  release)
- `e2e/tests/lifecycle/restart-persistence.spec.ts` (restart preserves
  channels and settings)
- `docker/tests/test-puid-pgid.sh`, run by
  `.github/workflows/lifecycle-tests.yml` (PUID/PGID honoured)
- `docker/tests/test-tls-postgres.sh`, run by
  `.github/workflows/lifecycle-tests.yml` (TLS Postgres connection)
