// Package channel owns a channel's lifecycle: ownership, the state machine,
// the switch coordination between the HTTP handlers and the channel's own
// goroutine, and the client registry.
//
// Empty at 2c-1. 2c-2 brings the first real type.
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CONTAIN, because the Python relay's
// equivalents are deleted rather than ported (spec D2):
//
//   - No ownership lease. One relay process per host by construction, so
//     there is never a second writer to fence against. live:channel:{id}:owner,
//     _ensure_owner_or_stop, release_ownership's non-atomic GET-compare-DELETE
//     and extend_ownership's non-atomic GET-EXPIRE all go. Ownership becomes
//     map[uuid]*Channel behind a sync.RWMutex.
//   - No follower path and no live:events:{id} pub/sub. Those were
//     multi-worker follower-to-owner coordination; with one owner per channel
//     by construction they have no purpose.
//   - No Redis client, and no Postgres driver. The phase's two checkable
//     invariants (spec § Stage 2c, "The two invariants"). Switch coordination
//     is a Go chan; the degraded-fallback source cache, the metadata hash, the
//     stopping flag and the timing counters are all fields on the channel
//     struct.
